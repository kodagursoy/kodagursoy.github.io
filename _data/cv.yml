    - title: Summer Research Grant/Senior Thesis
      institution: Princeton Economics Department
      year: Jun 2025 - Present
      description:
        - Advised by Professor Faruk Gul
        - Researching information aggregation in common-value elections when voters have Rank Dependent Expected Utility preferences.
        - Found that with RDEU preferences, information often fails to aggregate due to strong incentives against randomization, unlike the subjective expected utility case in which randomization at a cutoff signal can sustain informative equilibria.
        - Extending this work as my Senior Thesis.
    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Bleemer Economics Lab at Princeton University
      year: Jan 2024 - Present
      description:
        - Advised by Professor Zachary Bleemer
        - Co-author on the lab's project on wage and promotion gaps among University of California faculty.
        - Constructed a 250,000 entry dataset of all academic employees of the University of California system from 2006-2023, including position, department, and salary.
        - Used a combination web-scraping and LLM structured data extraction approach to aggregate the data from many sources, before implementing a matching protocol in R to generate the final dataset.
        - Began analysis of gender-pay gap and gap in tenure rates, using a basic fixed effects model to assess the share of the aggregate pay gap explainable by department, university, position, etc.
    - title: <em>Can Policies Regulating Information Acquisition Alleviate Statistical Discrimination?</em>
      institution: Princeton Economics Department
      year: Apr 2025
      description:
        - Junior Independent work, advised by Professor Adam Kapor
        - Complicated the Coate-Loury (1993) model of statistical discrimination by allowing employers to select signal structures using Rational Inattention machinery, then testing whether certain interventions could prevent the existence of discriminatory equilibria.'
    - title: Research Assistant for Professor Adam Kapor
      institution: Princeton University
      year: Jun 2024 - Aug 2024
      description:
        - 'Ran Julia simulations for "College Admissions with Preference Signals and Interdependent Values," a project combining common value auctions and matching to explore why schools segment markets for students (the "feeder school" phenomenon).'
        - Explored equilibrium properties in the binary qualification case, testing comparative statics of signal accuracy, equilibrium admission cutoffs, and university payoffs.
        - Endogenized signal accuracy subject to a cost function to examine comparative statics of information cost, equilibrium cutoffs, and payoffs.
