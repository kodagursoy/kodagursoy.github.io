I am a senior at Princeton University majoring in economics. My research interests are in microeconomic theory and behavioral economics, with applications to labor and public economics. I am particularly interested in how institutional design contributes to inequality.

I have worked with Professors Zachary Bleemer, Adam Kapor, and Faruk Gul on projects spanning both empirical and theoretical economics. Outside of academics, I am the head instructor of Princeton's Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu club, a member of the [Princeton Footnotes](https://open.spotify.com/track/52Vkt6SLDgx26tP4C0eKfY?si=ed253f6a8c7e41d5), and I write and produce my own [music](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Hc6gnzU4oMVIaojWkYI7H?si=N7MfB_s5Sp2KrrM6JqyTBQ).
