## Working Papers

### Can Policies Regulating Information Acquisition Alleviate Statistical Discrimination?

**Junior Independent Work** · Princeton University · April 2025 ·
*Advised by Professor Adam Kapor*

<div class="abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> I extend models of statistical discrimination by allowing employers to choose any information structure from which to receive signals about worker productivity, and provide a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of discriminatory equilibria. I then evaluate three affirmative action policies regulating employer signal acquisition. The first requires sufficient confidence in lack of qualification before assignment to the less desirable task; within the model, it never eliminates discrimination. The second requires sufficient confidence in qualification before hiring to the more desirable task; it can prevent discrimination under certain parameters but may also exacerbate disparities. The third requires equal desirable-task hiring probability for qualified workers across groups; it always eliminates discrimination. These results demand caution from those designing affirmative action policies regulating information acquisition.
