## Working Papers

### Can Policies Regulating Information Acquisition Alleviate Statistical Discrimination?

**Junior Independent Work** · Princeton University · April 2025 ·
*Advised by Professor Adam Kapor*

<div class="abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> I build on theoretical models of statistical discrimination by allowing employers to choose any information structure from which to receive signals about worker productivity using Rational Inattention machinery. I then provide a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of discriminatory equilibria. Next, I examine three affirmative action policies regulating employer signal acquisition. The first requires sufficient confidence in lack of qualification before rejection, and always fails to prevent discrimination. The second requires sufficient confidence in qualification before hiring to the desirable task, and can prevent discrimination under certain model parameters, but may also make discrimination strictly worse. The third requires equal desirable-task hiring probability for qualified workers across groups, and always succeeds in preventing discrimination. These results demand caution from those designing affirmative action policies regulating information acquisition.
